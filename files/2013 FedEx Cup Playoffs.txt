The BMW Championship was played September 12–16, after a one-week break. All 70 players eligible to play in the event did so. There was no cut. The tournament was scheduled to end on September 15 but the final round could not be completed on Sunday due to rain and finished on Monday.
Zach Johnson won by two strokes over Nick Watney. Two players played their way into the Tour Championship: Watney (ranked 34 to ranked 12) and Luke Donald (54 to 29). Two players played their way out of the Tour Championship: Harris English (28 to 31) and Lee Westwood (30 to 41).The top 30 players in FedEx Cup points after this event advanced to the Tour Championship and also earned spots in the 2014 Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, and (British) Open Championship.
With the FedEx Cup points reset after the BMW Championship, all 30 remaining players had at least a mathematical chance to secure the season crown, and any of the top five players could claim the FedEx Cup with a win in the Tour Championship.
