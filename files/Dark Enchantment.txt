Dark Enchantment is  a 1949 Australian play by Max Afford. 
It was based on a 1943 play by Afford called Sleep No Mpre


== Premise ==
Set in a London theatrical boarding house in 1895. A young girl, Julie, whose mother runs the house, receives an inheritance from a foreign ventriloquist, Kurtner: his doll, £1,000, and an accompanying "dark enchantment".


== Sleep No More ==
The play appears to be based on Sleep No More, an earlier play of Afford's . This play was set in a London boarding-house for theatrical types; a Rumanian ventriloquist, a student of Black Magic, bequeaths his doll to his wife, there are accidents and the wife suspects the doll is responsible.
The play was given a reading at the Independent Theatre in 1940. However it was not produced until 1943. The Sydney Morning Herald said it "lacks a good deal of the dramatic action of the playwright's earlier thriller, Lady in Danger." The Bulletin said the play "lacks most things necessary in a stage thriller, including the thrills. The first act is hopeful; the other two haven’t even  hope. All the characters come straight out of stock.... If Afford turned his energy to the Australian scene he’d probably find that his characters and plots would come to life with the background."


== Production History ==
Dark Enchantment premiered at the Minerva Theatre in Kings Cross Sydney in 1949.Afford's wife, Thelma, designed costumes for that production. The cast included Neva Carr Glynn and Grant Taylor. Reviews were mixed.The play later toured English provinces starring Ellen Pollock and Ernest Milton. Afford went to England to be involved in its production. The play did not transfer to the West End but had two different runs in 1950.


== Adaptations ==
Dark Enchantment was adapted for radio on the ABC in 1960.
